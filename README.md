Facebook API
Idea of the app
The task is to implement a small mobile app powered by Facebook API. The goal of the app is to let users browse and export their Facebook albums and photos.

Expected Behavior of the app
When the user lauches the app for the first time, he should be able to sign in with Facebook and grant access to his Facebook albums & photos.
After sign in & linking his Facebook account, the user should be able to see on the app home screen a grid/list of his albums from Facebook. The grid of albums should be paginated.
The user should be able to click on an album and show a grid of photos inside that album (grid of photos should be paginated).
The user should also be able to click on a photo to preview it full-screen.
[BONUS] The user should be able to select an album and export/upload all the photos inside that album to Firebase Storage.
